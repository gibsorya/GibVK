# LearnVulkan
This repo contains a Vulkan project I used to get a feel of Vulkan. I went through a tutorial at https://vulkan-tutorial.com/, but instead I broke the code up into multiple files and I used [vulkan-hpp](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp). This is the final version of the project and I will no longer be working on it.

# The Future
I have moved on to another Vulkan project, where I am implementing Vulkan on my own. In that project I will be using data-oriented programming instead of object-oriented programming. (Repo coming soon).

## What I implemented:
* Main graphics pipeline
* Swapchains
* Simple drawing with vertex's and vertices
* Texture mapping
* Depth
* Model loading
* Mipmaps
* Multisampling

### This is how far I got with the tutorial:

# LearnVulkan
This repo contains my Vulkan project for what I am learning. Going through the tutorial at https://vulkan-tutorial.com/, but instead I'm breaking the code up into multiple files and I'm also using [vulkan-hpp](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp). I am relatively new to C++ and its best practices for its project structure, so if you have any suggestions let me know!

### This is the progress I've made so far:
